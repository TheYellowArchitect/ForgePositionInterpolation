# ForgePositionInterpolation

This is a demo project for https://github.com/BeardedManStudios/ForgeNetworkingRemastered  
It was made to display a bug with its debug tools, specifically, that the bytes received/sent, increased alongside ping increase (which shouldn't happen)  
For this to be tested/displayed, I had to make a constant RPC sending, so it is obvious, and the classic is sending position.  
And I used the [classic snapshot system](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Source_Multiplayer_Networking), which I think everyone who is to use Forge seriously, will make more or less.  
You can use this to share anything, not just a mere 2D position.

**tl;dr: It has a fully finished and working position snapshot system, as expected from all FPS + it displays a minor bug if you emulate high ping**
